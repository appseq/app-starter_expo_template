NEW APP:
Rebuild the entire UI/UX of the app from the ground up. Ignore the existing UI completely;
act as if it does not exist. Do not reuse or reference any part of the current interface.

Use the attached images only as style, tone, and layout direction.
They are the visual template reference for the new design.
Create a fully new, modern, clean, mobile-first UI/UX based on these references.
If images or icons are needed, use Jina to search online sources (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, etc.).
Download every asset you use and store it locally with clear filenames. For each asset, provide the Jina search query, source URL, and local filename.

When producing UI components, layout structures, or implementation examples:
-Follow clean code standards.
-Prioritize reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
-Apply defensive programming techniques to ensure stability and robustness.
-Keep solutions simple—do not overengineer or introduce unnecessary abstractions.
-Prefer clarity and readability over cleverness.

Do not break functionality of the app.

App store screenshots:
Transform the attached images into polished, stylish Apple App Store screenshots. The screenshots must look professionally designed and marketing-ready. Use the following link as the visual design and layout inspiration:

Rebuild the entire UI/UX of the app from the ground up. Ignore the existing UI completely;
act as if it does not exist. Do not reuse or reference any part of the current interface.
Use the reference app source code 'rork-app-anitque-id' to rebuild the app UI and UX.
Additionally find the reference images in this directory: '/Users/mo/Projects/Graphics/Ideation/Zophi - Antique Identifier'
Focus on the UI and UX, keep the technical source structure intact like the scrips, services, utils, use of aiproxy and config setup.
-Follow clean code standards.
-Prioritize reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
-Apply defensive programming techniques to ensure stability and robustness.

---------------------------------------------
Investigate on how to make the codebase for this app bare-bones so it can be served as a template to build new apps.
All app specific views need to be removed, replaced with a sinle startup view with minimal UI.

Requirements:
- maintain infrastructure skeleton of the project
- maintain configuration config.json
- maintain tooling like localization lib, AIProxy, RevenueCat, SuperWall, Jina, Exa and all api-keys and related services
- maintain fastlane tooling
- mantain all .claude scripts and shortcuts

Make sure bare-bone project builds and runs, no syntax or build errors are introduced.

NEW APP

Create a new app following the specs below.
Make the UI clean, professional and polished.

Reference example:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/convert-to-pdf-photo-scanner/id6749334400

Tech stack:
RN Expo
zustand
NPM

Description and functionality:
Copy App Store description of app

---------------------------------------------
1) Clone the RORK app locally.
2) Open the RN Expo start template in Claude
3) Add the RORK app folder path to claude
4) Prompt:
Goal:
Analyze the current app’s full codebase and project structure (including the referenced directory).
Transform the template into a production-ready, fully working app by:
Adopting the UI/UX from the referenced app
Integrating all functionality and business logic with the UI as the system foundation

Implementing logic and code based on the embedded configurations in the template app
(use config files, constants, and services such as config.json/config.json, constants, constants, and services as the source of truth for implementation)

Mapping existing functionality → UI behavior without breaking core logic 
work in steps, evaluate each step.

Standards:
Clean, modular, reusable, maintainable architecture
Clear separation of concerns, loosely coupled, composable UI components
Defensive programming with safe states, validation, guards, and error handling

Output:
Deliver a complete, stable, maintainable, working app that:
Matches the referenced app’s UI/UX
Implements accurate logic as implied by the interface
Uses a scalable, modular project structure rooted in the template’s configurations

The template codebase has generic functionalities that can be used in all new apps. 
Compare current template codebase with the PDFScanner codebase. 
Find and list all differences and suggest which improvements in the PDFScanner can be implemented in the template codebase.
