ONBOARDING:
Understand and analyse the current code the proceed to the following requirement:
Rebuild the onboarding from ground up, do not base it on the current onboarding, forget about the current onboarding completely. Rebuild from zero and make it slick, polished and must fit the overall theme and context of the app,
introduce the user to the most important features of the app, use illustrations downloaded from the net or unsplash or cutouts to explain and promote the featurs, make it a beautifull but also an interesting experience.
Look at the majority target users and focus on promoting the value that’s most relevant to them.
Provide the best possible UI/UX specifically for those users — the ones who will get the most value out of the brand/app.
You can do anything across all realms: use animations, libraries, or even generate SVG prompts that you think best suit this section.Or find images on https://unsplash.com/ that would fit the app. Go wild.
Create a unique UX that still delivers the same core value but in a way that stands out and adds more perceived value because of its originality. Flat plain minimalism is preferred no kitchy design or overuse of icons or colors.
It maintains flat minimalism, breathes professionalism, matches the overall app style, and delivers exceptional value to target user.
Think beyond your usual limits. Are you pumped up for this?
Requirements:
- All pictures, screens and icons need to be downloaded and stored locally in the assets folders/onboarding
- Evaluate the best approach on whether to use jina or your inbuild method to fetch online assets
