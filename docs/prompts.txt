GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Ensure all adaptations remain simple and straightforward. Verify that modifications do not break existing functionality. Leverage current features as much as possible to avoid redundancy and unnecessary complexity while at the same time adhering to principles of clean code, re-use and easy maintainability.
When any ambiguity arises, ask clarifying questions and proceed methodically.  
Prioritize using established artifacts for guidance.
In case of something is not clear, ask for more info before deciding on the implementation.
Provide changes with full adapted files for clarity. 
Don't adapt anything else than what was required.
Do after each iteration a self evaluation and validation to prevent regression and bugs.

Understand and analyse the current code the proceed to the following requirement:\
the identifier result screen needs to be adapted according the app's functionalities, identificatin of classic cars, adapt the screen to show details related to identification of classic cars. adapt the styling to fit the apps styling and feeling. Some suggestion details to show, evaluate these details, find other details that might fit better:
name, power, top speed, year, value, production time-span, country, number production, desciption and fun fact. Focus on the requirement make sure to not introduce any other regression, if in doubt ask for feedback before implementation. 
-------------------
Read, understand and analyse the code thoroughly the proceed with following request:
Convert the existing app to the following:
Work out the following idea for a hybrid ios/android using react native expo:
I need the current code template to converted to a ‘classic car identifier’ app. Goal is to revamp and re-design from scratch the complete design of the app including the onboarding, main menu and options pages.
Do the necessary changes, to achieve the following:
Take the role of an export senior designer and use your experience of past years and projects to craft a design that'll be remembered as the iconic achievement of your career.
Create a React Native Expo app for identifying classic cars from 1960 onwards. Design it with a modern UI that incorporates nostalgic automotive elements - use warm orange tones (`#ea580c` primary), elegant typography  headings, and smooth animations.

Include a 3-step onboarding flow using Lottie animations (react-native-lottie or @lottiefiles/dotlottie-react-native) or React Native Reanimated for smooth transitions that introduces users to: taking photos, AI identification, viewing history, and exploring collections.

For resources: use high-quality classic car images from Unsplash, Pexels, or generate placeholder images with queries like 'vintage 1960s muscle car', 'classic convertible dashboard', 'collection of vintage automobiles'. Include subtle automotive-inspired background patterns or textures.

The main app should featuer on it's main screen a trivia, a central camera/upload interface using expo-camera and expo-image-picker, recent identification history.
The main screen should contain interessting trivia that refreshes after a certain time. Trivia's should be fetched from the internet, look for a stable and free service. 
Design a clean mobile-first design. Use expo-linear-gradient for subtle background effects and react-native-svg for custom icons. Give the app an unique look and feel; not similar to the original rock identifier.

Add beautiful classic car imagery and make it feel both contemporary and nostalgic.

First plan out and setup a playbook how to proceed with this ambitious and exciting project, after validation proceed step by step.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 I asked to completely revamp and change the design of the app, the design can not be similary as the current design, the main page should be redesigned with tabs as was requested. Go back to original request and follow it closely, be focused and start first with design changes, use all necessary tooling at your desposal. Take the role of an export senior designer and use your experience of past years and projects to craft a design that'll be remembered as the iconic achievement of your career. Plan, design and craft, go. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 Read, understand and analyse the code thoroughly the proceed with following request:
 I want the current to be converted into a clean template where all UI and UX is reset to the minimum default expo default. Keep the configuration that will be used to setup a new app, remove all components and ui that are related to the specific rock identifier app. The goal is to make a clean and template that can used to create a new app starting only from the configuration and constants. Keep the fastlane and docs folders in place.

Understand and analyse the current code the proceed to the following requirement:
Rebuild the onboarding from ground up, do not base it on the current onboarding, forget about the current onboarding completely. Rebuild from zero and make it slick, polished and must fit the overall theme and context of the app,
introduce the user to the most important features of the app, use illustrations downloaded from the net or unsplash or cutouts to explain and promote the featurs, make it a beautifull but also an interesting experience.
Look at the majority target users and focus on promoting the value that’s most relevant to them.
Provide the best possible UI/UX specifically for those users — the ones who will get the most value out of the brand/app.
You can do anything across all realms: use animations, libraries, or even generate SVG prompts that you think best suit this section.Or find images on https://unsplash.com/ that would fit the app. Go wild.
Create a unique UX that still delivers the same core value but in a way that stands out and adds more perceived value because of its originality. Flat plain minimalism is preferred no kitchy design or overuse of icons or colors.
It maintains flat minimalism, breathes professionalism, matches the overall app style, and delivers exceptional value to target user.
Think beyond your usual limits. Are you pumped up for this?

• Change review for the double-load fix:

  - components/PaywallProvider.tsx: Adds an isProviderReady gate and shows a full-screen loader until the Superwall provider finishes loading (or fails), then renders children
    exactly once. This prevents the prior RevenueCat→Superwall provider swap that was remounting the entire tree and causing the main screen to appear twice. Fallback now cleanly
    uses RevenueCat if Superwall fails to load.
  - docs/prompts.txt: Only appended the investigation prompt; no behavioral impact.
