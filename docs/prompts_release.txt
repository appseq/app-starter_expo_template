Lets prepare all the metadata needed to build the app store page.
Find the metadata folder in ios/fastlane, go through all the metadata textfiles and adapt for maximum marketing conversation for app's target audience. 
Complete or improve the metadata for description, keywords, promotional_text and set the release notes. Make sure that keywords total length do not exceed 100 chars.
